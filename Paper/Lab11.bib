  abstract = {Many interesting and important optimization problems require the
determination of a best order of performing a given set of operations.
This paper is concerned with the solution of three such sequencing problems:
a scheduling problem involving arbitrary cost functions, the travelingsalesman
problein, and an assembly-line blancing problem. Each of these
problems has a structure permitting solution by means of recursion schemes
of the type associated with dynamic programming. In essence, these recursion
schemes permit the problems to be treated in terms of combinations,
rather than permutations, of the operations to be performed. The dynamic
programming formulations are given in 1, together with a discussion of
various extensions such as the inclusion of precedence constraints. In each
case the proposed method of solution is computationally effective for
problems in a certain limited range. Approximate solutions to larger
problems may be obtained by solving sequences of small derived problems,
each having the same structure as the original one. This procedure of successive
approximations is developed in detail in 2 with specific reference
to the traveling-salesman problem, and 3 summarizes computational experience
with an IBM 7090 program using the procedure.},

  abstract = {We propose a new method of solving the traveling salesman problem in this Letter. A new technique,
whose concept comes from real space renormalization theory, is introduced to solve the combinatorial
problem of operation research. Examples of the calculation applied from the 48-cities to the 532-
cities problem and a theoretical estimate of the computational effort are presented. It was found that
the present method belongs to the group of the fastest computing algorithm of the traveling salesman
problem. Throughout this work we show an interesting cross of operation research and statistical
physics.},

  abstract = {The travelling salesman problem, in which the best route between cities to be visited is chosen from a large number of possible routes, is reconsidered using the time reversal of physical dynamics, e.g. an inverse of the diffusion process. Information mediators assigned to every city diffuse as time passes, eventually merging into a single peak. When the time reversal of the dynamics is performed, the single peak splits into two peaks, each of which splits into two peaks, eventually resulting in peaks at all the cities. The hierarchy of the above bifurcations tells us how the distribution of the cities looks as the level of focus changes. This scheme is applied to a travelling salesman problem involving 532 US cities, the result of which is a 17% longer path than the optimal path.},

  abstract = {The renormalization group has proven to be a very powerful tool in physics for treating systems with many length scales. Here we show how it can be adapted to provide a new class of algorithms for discrete optimization. The heart of our method uses renormalization and recursion, and these processes are embedded in a genetic algorithm. The system is self-consistently optimized on all scales, leading to a high probability of finding the ground state configuration. To demonstrate the generality of such an approach, we perform tests on traveling salesman and spin glass problems. The results show that our “genetic renormalization algorithm” is extremely powerful.},
